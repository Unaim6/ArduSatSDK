/** @brief  Library for Arduino returns data on temperature from MLX90614 sensor

	Notes:
	Designed for use with Melexis (C) MLX90614 Infrared Thermometer
	Library gathers temperature data over I2C Bus/SM Bus
	Tested with MLX90614 from Sparkfun, 4.7k Ohm pull-up resistors, .1uF capacitor, and Arduino Uno
