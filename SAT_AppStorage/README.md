SAT_AppStorage
==========

SAT_AppStorage is a Nanosatisfi library that provides access to long-term experimental storage device.
An arduino program running on the satellite calls sys_appdata_write() to write data to its
associated storage device.  Data sent when experiment is completed; see System.exit()
